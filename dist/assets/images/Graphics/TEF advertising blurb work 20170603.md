<i>"Captivating" – K.L.</i>

<i>"Science fiction of the highest caliber… [It] allows us to contemplate what it means to be human – the essence of enduring literature." – D.M.</i>

<i>"Best SF I’ve read all year… a richly textured, vivid, insanely readable story of interstellar cultures colliding and ordinary people struggling to be themselves amidst the horrors of a far-future war that may be on the edge of a genocidal resolution." – F.S.</i>

<i>"I loved it and devoured it" – E.A.</i>



<b>The eternal war is about to end…</b>

<b>…but not the way anyone wants.</b>

Sethlan is an officer of the empire. He was raised from birth to fight in the trenches that span the continent: <i>The Eternal Front</i>.

<i>Lucky Strike</i> is an intelligent independent prospector ship. It wants colonization rights for the planet, but first it has to let the inhabitants knock themselves back to the stone age. Hanging in orbit, influencing both sides, it crafts the death of the world. 

Sethlan sees his war changing but he can’t find the cause. Now the Eternal Front is on the brink of collapse, and its violence will spread like wildfire to ravage the entire planet.

Desperate, outclassed, and under suspicion from the imperial secret police, Sethlan frantically untangles the <i>Lucky Strike</i>’s plans. Along the way he stumbles across a hidden conspiracy – and a possible solution: <i>a popular revolt against the empire itself.</i>

It comes down to a choice Sethlan doesn’t want to make. He can betray a lifetime of service or he can watch his world burn.

On a poisoned world... in the last days of the empire... a tenacious officer discovers a conspiracy from beyond the stars. 

Sethlan Semelon loses his entire unit to a gas attack between the trenches. It's a decisive loss in a war spanning 100 years, but it's only the first betrayal. Each twist draws him deeper into a web of secret police, rebels, and off-world conspirators. 

A stunningly inventive and exquisitely realized alien battlescape. Read The Eternal Front and plunge into a civilization on the brink of collapse!




Grigory is a poisoned world, an ancient dumping ground for a race of "Polluted" humans. They were genetically programmed to be a fast-breeding, disposable army for some long-forgotten interstellar conflict, and now the world is locked in a perpetual trench war: The Eternal Front.

Captain Semelon is a war-weary officer who discovers powerful off-world interests manipulating the war, bringing the Eternal Front to the brink of collapse. When the lines break, the violence will spread like wildfire and ravage the entire planet.

As chaos mounts, Semelon desperately untangles the conspiracy against his world. Clawing through a ferocious alien battlescape, hunting clues among secret police and dangerous political subversives, he begins to wonder if his violent, war-ridden people are worth saving at all. 

What one reviewer described as: "Science fiction of the highest caliber... [It] allows us to contemplate what it means to be human -- the essence of enduring literature."

Brilliant, beautiful, burdened with responsibility. Nanatique Naremsa is the "alewife" of the 314th Observer unit, of the 314th Observers. "Nana" is the unit's alewife. Part barkeep, part psychiatrist, part effigy|idol|figurehead, her role is to urge the dangerously broken officers of her unit back into the trenches of the eternal front. She's a throwback, immune to the ancient genetic programming [that afflicts the minds and bodies of her people] that makes her people perfect soldiers but broken souls.  She has a talent for manipulating the broken minds of her Polluted people.

In olden times Nana would have been a dashtalaxan, a "hag worth listening to"

Brilliant, beautiful, and obligated to betray her people. 
Brilliant, beautiful, and trained to manipulate and betray. 
Nanatique Naremsa is the "alewife" of the 314th Observer unit. Part barkeep, part psychotherapist, her role is to urge her dangerously broken officers back into the trenches of the eternal front. She sends them back, over and over, until they fail to return and are listed in the roles as, "Finally Dead." She hates the empire and its neverending war but she's there for a reason: her brothers are at the front, and it's their turn to despair, go mad, and finally die. Not on her watch. Nana is a simple barkeep -- can she really bring down the empire and stop the eternal war? Try to stop her.
Meet Nana, Sethlan, Diggery, Jephesandra, and many others in The Eternal Front.
