# Explanation for files in assets/styles


`site.scss` -- this is what the gulpfile calls to build the CSS. It only pulls in `flashflex/_base.scss`.

`sources-and-projects-for-reference/` -- This is a dumping ground for various libraries and 3rd party projects, as well as past versions, which might be used during development. This folder will not be part of the final website.
