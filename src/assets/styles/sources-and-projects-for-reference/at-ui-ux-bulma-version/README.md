```sh
sass-convert --from sass --to scss temp.sass temp.scss
```

## Install

Install with git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wflaschka/at-ui-ux.git at-ui-ux
```

Update npm:

```sh
npm update
```

After dependencies are downloaded, continue to the next step and compile the site.

## Using this repository

Compile with `gulp`:

```sh
gulp #cleans dist/, builds to /dist, watches /src
gulp clean # cleans dist/
gulp watch # watches /src for changes and builds to /dist
gulp sass # generate CSS, SassDoc, SourceMap for CSS
```


Run browsersync for updates while developing:
```sh
cd dist && ./browsersync.sh
```

After browsersync, you'll have a server running (probably on port `3000`) and you can load:

* Project landing page http://localhost:3000
* SassDocs for the project: http://localhost:3000/assets/styles/sassdoc/

Get browsersync for your computer at [https://browsersync.io/](https://browsersync.io/).
