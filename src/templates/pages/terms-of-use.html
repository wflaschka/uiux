That means you’ll defend Marketplace (including any of our employees) and hold us harmless from any legal claim or demand (including reasonable attorney’s fees) that arises from your actions, your use (or misuse) of our Services, your breach of the Terms or your account’s infringement of someone else’s rights.</p><p>We reserve the right to handle our legal defense however we see fit, even if you are indemnifying us, in which case you agree to cooperate with us so we can execute our strategy.</p><p>Disputes Resolution</p><p>If you find yourself in a dispute with another user of Marketplace’s Services or a third party, we encourage you to contact the other party and try to resolve the dispute amicably.</p><p>Marketplace will attempt to help you resolve disputes in good faith and based solely on our interpretation of our policies, in our sole discretion; we will not make judgments regarding legal issues or claims.

These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live.</li><li><strong>ARBITRATION</strong>: You and Marketplace agree that any dispute or claim arising from or relating to the Terms shall be finally settled by arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neural arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by the courts. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under the Terms will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted</li><li><strong>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THE TERMS, YOU AND Marketplace ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</strong>: Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator. Please visit ADR Institute of Canada for more information about arbitration.</li><li><strong>FORUM</strong>: If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Marketplace Exchange agree that the claim will be brought exclusively in courts located in Vancouver. British Columbia, Canada (including the Superior Court of Justice and the Federal Court). You and Marketplace Exchange expressly consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and waive any and all objections to venue or jurisdiction in, the courts in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for such purpose. However, you or Marketplace Exchange may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its intellectual property rights and any claims regarding infringement or misappropriation of its intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li></ol><h2>Changes to the Terms</h2><p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll definitely let you know by doing one (or more) of the following: (1) posting the changes through the Services or (2) sending you an email or message about the changes. That way you can decide whether you want to continue using the Services. Changes will be effective upon the posting of the changes. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any changes. Your continued use of the Services following the changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p><h2>General Legal Provisions</h2><p>The Terms, including all of the policies that make up the Terms, supersede any other agreement between you and Marketplace regarding the Services. If any part of the Terms is found to be unenforceable, that part will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any part of the Terms is not a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of the Terms. We may assign any of our rights and obligations under the Terms.</p><h2>Contact Information</h2><p>For any additional questions email: <a href="mailto:info@Marketplace.com" target="_blank" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">info@Marketplace.com</a>.</p><p><em>Last updated 28/08/2015</em></p>
